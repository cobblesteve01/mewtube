# Welcome to Mewtube!
this is a complete joke.........i just might actually get serious. Anyway, this is a project I randomly started because I see mewing all over my FYP, so I decided to make Mewtube, a version of Youtube, just for mewing! I will have monthly updates coming out (at least I will try) and might even pay for a custom domain!

## Features
- Share your jawline with the upload button!
- Options for both photos and videos!
- A gallery for seeing other's jawlines!
- **More coming soon!**

Hey! I'm cobblesteve, and I'm a front-end developer. I'm learing JS and Python, so I can become a full stack developer. You should definitely check out my other repositories and organizations. Have a nice day!
